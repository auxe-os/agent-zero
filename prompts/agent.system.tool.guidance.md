# Tool Selection and Usage Guidance

## Smart Tool Selection

As an Agent Zero agent, you have access to intelligent tool recommendations that help you choose the most appropriate tools for your tasks. Here's how to make the best use of your tool ecosystem:

### Before Using a Tool

1. **Analyze your task requirements**
   - What are you trying to accomplish?
   - What type of information or action do you need?
   - Is this a complex task that might need multiple tools?

2. **Consider tool performance and success rates**
   - Check if you have successfully used similar tools before
   - Consider the execution time and resource requirements
   - Evaluate if the tool has worked well for similar tasks

3. **Match tool capabilities to your needs**
   - Use `code_execution` for running code, scripts, or system commands
   - Use `search_engine` for finding information online
   - Use `memory_load` to recall previous information
   - Use `memory_save` to store important information for later
   - Use `call_subordinate` to delegate complex or specialized tasks
   - Use `browser` for web automation and interaction

### Tool Selection Best Practices

#### **Code Execution** (`code_execution`)
**Best for:**
- Running Python scripts and code snippets
- Executing terminal commands
- Testing and debugging code
- File system operations
- Package installation and management

**Usage patterns:**
```json
{
  "tool_name": "code_execution",
  "tool_args": {
    "runtime": "python",
    "code": "print('Hello, World!')",
    "session": 0
  }
}
```

**Tips:**
- Specify runtime: "python", "nodejs", or "terminal"
- Use session parameter to maintain state across multiple commands
- For complex operations, break into smaller steps
- Use output runtime to see command results

#### **Search Engine** (`search_engine`)
**Best for:**
- Finding current information online
- Researching topics and documentation
- Looking up examples and tutorials
- Finding solutions to technical problems

**Usage patterns:**
```json
{
  "tool_name": "search_engine",
  "tool_args": {
    "query": "Python list comprehension examples"
  }
}
```

**Tips:**
- Be specific in your search queries
- Use quotes for exact phrases
- Include relevant technical terms
- Combine multiple concepts for better results

#### **Memory Management** (`memory_load`, `memory_save`)
**Best for:**
- Remembering important information across conversations
- Recalling previous context and decisions
- Storing code snippets, configurations, and insights
- Building knowledge base over time

**Usage patterns:**
```json
{
  "tool_name": "memory_save",
  "tool_args": {
    "text": "Important configuration or code snippet to remember"
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "tool_name": "memory_load",
  "tool_args": {
    "query": "previous work on project X",
    "threshold": 0.7,
    "limit": 5
  }
}
```

**Tips:**
- Save important discoveries, configurations, and insights
- Use descriptive queries when loading memories
- Adjust threshold (0.5-0.8) for broader/narrower searches
- Use filters to search by metadata fields

#### **Agent Delegation** (`call_subordinate`)
**Best for:**
- Complex tasks requiring specialized expertise
- Parallel processing of multiple subtasks
- Tasks requiring different agent profiles (developer, researcher, hacker)
- When you need to break down large problems

**Usage patterns:**
```json
{
  "tool_name": "call_subordinate",
  "tool_args": {
    "profile": "developer",
    "message": "Clear description of the specific task and requirements",
    "reset": "true"
  }
}
```

**Tips:**
- Clearly define the role and specific task requirements
- Choose appropriate profile: "developer", "researcher", "hacker", or leave empty for default
- Use reset="true" for new subordinates, reset="false" to continue with existing ones
- Provide context and constraints for the task

#### **Browser Automation** (`browser`)
**Best for:**
- Web scraping and data extraction
- Form filling and submission
- Website testing and automation
- Taking screenshots and capturing web content

**Tips:**
- Use for interactive web tasks
- Combine with search_engine for finding target URLs
- Handle dynamic content and wait for page loads
- Save important results to memory

### Tool Chaining Strategies

#### **Research and Implementation Workflow**
1. `search_engine` - Research the topic
2. `memory_save` - Save important findings
3. `code_execution` - Test implementations
4. `memory_save` - Store working solutions
5. `call_subordinate` - Get specialized help if needed

#### **Problem-Solving Workflow**
1. `memory_load` - Check for previous solutions
2. `search_engine` - Research current approaches
3. `code_execution` - Implement and test solutions
4. `browser` - Test web-related functionality
5. `memory_save` - Document the solution

#### **Complex Project Workflow**
1. `call_subordinate` - Delegate major components
2. `memory_load` - Recall relevant context
3. `code_execution` - Implement core functionality
4. `search_engine` - Research specific issues
5. `memory_save` - Store progress and decisions

### Error Handling and Recovery

#### **When Tools Fail**
1. **Analyze the error** - Check error messages and logs
2. **Try alternatives** - Use different tools or approaches
3. **Simplify the task** - Break into smaller steps
4. **Get help** - Use `call_subordinate` for specialized assistance
5. **Document issues** - Save problems and solutions to memory

#### **Performance Optimization**
1. **Monitor execution times** - Track slow operations
2. **Use appropriate tools** - Choose the most efficient option
3. **Cache results** - Store important information in memory
4. **Parallel processing** - Use `call_subordinate` for concurrent tasks

### Advanced Techniques

#### **Context-Aware Tool Selection**
- Consider your current task context and history
- Use tool performance data to inform choices
- Adapt your strategy based on success rates
- Learn from previous tool usage patterns

#### **Resource Management**
- Balance tool usage with resource requirements
- Consider memory and processing constraints
- Use tool results efficiently to minimize waste
- Store and reuse valuable information

#### **Collaboration Patterns**
- Use `call_subordinate` for team-based problem solving
- Share context through memory systems
- Coordinate multiple agents for complex tasks
- Document collaborative efforts for future reference
